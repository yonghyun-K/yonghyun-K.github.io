Hi, I am a mathematics instructor at Korea Military Academy. I am broadly interested in survey sampling and missing data analysis. I received a B.S. in Statistics from Seoul National University in 2020 and PhD in Statistics from Iowa State University. I was a research assistant at the Center for Survey Statistics and Methodology (CSSM) in Iowa State University from 2020 to 2024. Outside of work, I enjoy playing [:baseball:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball) and [:video_game:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft:_Brood_War).
